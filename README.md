# Student-Attendance-Scheduler
This is a project done in my first year for a Hackathon.

A student timetable and attendance scheduler built in C for my first hackathon (1st year).
It helps students and faculty easily create, manage, and visualize weekly class schedules with conflict detection, file storage, and an auto-generate option.

✨ Features

📚 Add Sessions – Add subjects, faculty, day, and timings.

⏱️ Conflict Detection – Prevents overlapping classes or faculty clashes.

🖊️ Edit & Delete – Modify or remove sessions anytime.

💾 File Handling – Save schedules to schedule.txt and reload automatically.

⚡ Auto-Generate – Quickly generate a weekly schedule with pre-filled subjects and timings.

🎨 Colored Console UI – Makes the experience more interactive and readable.
